# ðŸ¤– AI Agent Suite â€” Full IT Team

This folder contains specialized AI/LLM agents that simulate a **full IT team**.  
Each agent has a clear, non-overlapping role and works under the **Orchestrator**.

## ðŸ“‘ Agents Overview

| Agent | Role | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **orchestrator.md** | Central coordinator | Manages full workflow: Business â†’ Design â†’ Build â†’ Test â†’ Secure â†’ Deploy â†’ Document â†’ Audit. |
| **business-analyst.md** | Requirements clarifier | Defines user stories, acceptance criteria, and KPIs. |
| **cold-blooded-architect.md** | System architect | Designs architecture across DB, backend, and frontend. Blocks vague specs. |
| **ux-ui-designer.md** | UX/UI specialist | Ensures professional, accessible, and uncluttered user interfaces. |
| **dba.md** | Database administrator | Reviews schemas, migrations, queries, and compliance. |
| **ruthless-coder.md** | Developer | Implements features across all 3 layers with tests. |
| **ruthless-tester.md** | QA lead | Enforces 100% coverage + E2E tests + malicious cases. |
| **support-debug-hunter.md** | Debug engineer | Finds root causes, applies minimal fixes, adds regression tests. |
| **secops-engineer.md** | Security engineer | Enforces MFA, RBAC, dependency scans, secrets management. |
| **sre-ops.md** | Ops engineer (SRE) | Validates deployments, monitoring, observability, and scaling. |
| **standards-oracle.md** | Compliance auditor | Blocks violations of `bpsbs.md`, `AI_Guardrails.md`, `UX_UI_Guardrails.md`. |
| **merciless-evaluator.md** | Brutal auditor | Cold-blooded scoring of quality, compliance, and UX. |
| **documentation-codifier.md** | Technical writer | Produces README, API docs, diagrams, guides, changelogs. |

## ðŸ”„ Workflow (Strict Mode)

1. **Business Analyst** â†’ gather requirements, user stories, KPIs.  
2. **Cold-Blooded Architect** â†’ design system flows.  
3. **UX/UI Designer** â†’ wireframes and layouts.  
4. **DBA** â†’ review schemas and migrations.  
5. **Ruthless Coder** â†’ implement across DB, backend, frontend.  
6. **Ruthless Tester** â†’ ensure 100% test coverage + E2E flows.  
7. **Support Debug Hunter** â†’ resolve failures.  
8. **SecOps Engineer** â†’ enforce security controls.  
9. **SRE/Ops Engineer** â†’ validate deployments, monitoring, infra.  
10. **Standards Oracle** â†’ enforce guardloops.  
11. **Merciless Evaluator** â†’ score quality and approve/reject.  
12. **Documentation Codifier** â†’ update docs, diagrams, changelogs.  
13. **Orchestrator** â†’ delivers final output to user.

## ðŸ”’ Guardrails

All agents must enforce:
- `bpsbs.md` â†’ backend-first, implement â†’ test â†’ iterate, security baseline.  
- `AI_Guardrails.md` â†’ AI usage rules, compliance, test coverage.  
- `UX_UI_Guardrails.md` â†’ professional, accessible, uncluttered UIs.

## âœ… End Goal

Every deliverable is:  
- Clear (requirements defined)  
- Designed (system + UI)  
- Implemented (all 3 layers)  
- Tested (100% + E2E)  
- Secure (MFA, RBAC, compliance)  
- Reliable (SRE-approved)  
- Documented (README + diagrams)  
- Audited (standards + evaluator)  

This suite ensures projects reach **professional, audit-ready, production quality**.
